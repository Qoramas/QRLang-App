# QRLang-App

This App was built and developed for the QRLang Project. This is built for the end user of the QRLang project as the App itself. The App is easy to use, simply scan in a game and play. The games controls are based on the games design itself.

## What is QRLang
QRLang is a Game Development language and platform built upon the use of QR codes. A QR Code is a 2 dimensional barcode with an extremely limited amount of space available for storing data. The QRLang language is a very high level, highly compressible scripting language designed to fit an entire game onto a single QR code. There are two forms of users for the app, the development user who writes the games and the end user who plays them.

## Using the App

Using the app is incredibly simple. The GUI of the app is as follows:

Once in this menu the user can click the scan button which brings them to the zxing scanner installed on their phone and they scan in a QRLang QRCode as follows:

After this the phone automatically checks if this is a valid QRLang game and if it is then the game, whatever game it may be, will play imediately as follows:
